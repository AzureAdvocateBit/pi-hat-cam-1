"""A Raspberry Pi app to capture video and upload to Azure Blob storageg.

Original code: https://github.com/jimbobbennett/pi-hat-cam

This code is designed to be used in a wearable camera, such as a hat camera. It captures
short bursts of video and uploads them to blob storage, retrying if there are any
connection issues.

The idea is to have a Pi Zero W tethered to a phone continuously uploading, and if signal is lost,
it will keep retrying. The short bursts allow the videos to be upoaded quickly to avoid loss of
videos if the signal is interrupted or the device ggets damaged. Files are named based on the
timestamp of when the recording started.

To use this, you will need an Azure subscription, and a storage account set up.

If you don't have a subscription you can sign up for free:

* If you are a student aged 18 and up and have an email address from an academic institution, you
  can sign up for the free Azure for Students offer at https://aka.ms/FreeStudentAzure without a
  credit card. At the time of writing this gives you $100 of credit to use over 12 months, as
  well as free tiers of a number of services for that 12 months. At the end of the 12 months, if
  you are still a student you can renew and get another $100 in credit and 12 months of
  free services.

* If you are not a student, you can sign up at https://aka.ms/FreeAz. You will need a credit card
  for verification purposes only, you will not be billed unless you decide to upgrade your account
  to a paid offering. At the time of writing the free account will give you US$200 of free credit
  to spend on what you like in the first 30 days, 12 months of free services, plus a load of
  services that have tiers that are always free.

For instructions to set up the storage account, check out the README for this repo at
https://GitHub.com/jimbobbennett/pi-hat-cam

Once you have set up storage, create a .env file with the following values:

BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING=<storage connection string>
CONTAINER_NAME=<blob container name>
VIDEO_LENGTH=<length of the short videos in seconds>
QUALITY=<quality from 1-40>
RESOLUTION=<resolution of videos as w,h>

* BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING needs to be set to the connection string for your storage account.
* CONTAINER_NAME is optional and should be set to the name of the container. If you leave
  this out, the default of videos is used.
* VIDEO_LENGTH is the length in seconds of each short video. This is optional, and if left out
  defaults to 10s.
* QUALITY is the quality of the video, ranging from 1 (highest quality), to 40 (lowest quality).
  The default is 30 which gives reasonable videos at about 500KB per 10 seconds at 720p.
* RESOLUTION is the resolution of the videos to capture. This needs to be in a supported video
  resolution for the camera. You can see the different resolutions supported in the Raspberry
  Pi Camera docs - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/camera/. This should be as
  w,h for example 1280,720 for 720p resolution. The default is 720p
